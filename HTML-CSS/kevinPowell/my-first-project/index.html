                <h2>What is Bouldering?</h2>
                <p>
                    Bouldering is a form of rock climbing that is performed on small rock formations or artificial rock walls without the use of ropes or harnesses.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Unlike <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_climbing" target="_blank">traditional climbing</a>, bouldering focuses on short but intensive routes called "problems," typically keeping climbers within a safe distance from the ground while they navigate challenging sequences of moves.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Experience the perfect blend of <strong>physical challenge and mental puzzle-solving</strong> as you navigate routes close to the ground, with nothing but a crash pad and determination. Bouldering strips climbing down to its purest form, making it both <strong>accessible to beginners and endlessly challenging for experts</strong>.
